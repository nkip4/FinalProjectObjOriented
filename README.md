Predictive model for D3 cross-country athletes
# D3 Athlete Performance Simulator

## üèÉ Project Description

This Python-based simulation tool helps predict 8k race times for Division III cross-country athletes. It accounts for factors such as nutrition, sleep, mental state, training load, and course conditions (e.g., temperature, wind, terrain). The tool models performance with a predictive scoring system and simulates individual or multiple athletes for leaderboard comparison.
